jamRadio (provisoric name)
==============================

(http://puu.sh/3c2ty.png "Screenshot") (outdated!)

Web-application to find new music to listen to, much like a radio channel.

The working method is easy, the page autorefreshes after 20 sec if there is no song in the current playlist
else it will play the song and refresh the page after the song is finished, to play the next song.
The Tracks you add will be heared by others.
The tracks others add will be heard by you.

The page is working, but it does not have any easy method of adding songs to the playlist and the playback method isent that great.

Here's a link to the curent webpage: http://sp.svennp.com/JamRadio/

all code for the project will be added once we have a mostly working project.
